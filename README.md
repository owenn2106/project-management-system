# Project Management System with Django

This is a WebApp created with Django & Bootstrap 5.
Database used in this project is SQLite3. *Note: This will be updated into the future into PostgreSQL*

It has multiple functionalities such as:
- CRUD Operations
- Filtering (Using Django Filters)
- Django Forms

Feel free to git pull or git clone the file and run the server using `python manage.py runserver`.

### Additional Note: I might have pip freeze the wrong packages into the requirements.txt so please do not use pip install requirements.txt for this specific project.
